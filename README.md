# Kopilka

Kopilka allows you to quickly and easily track what you spend your money on and where it comes from.

You can also save and load application settings. Russian and English languages are supported.

Overall, the application is simple, and there is no need to elaborate on all its features.

It is best to download it and see for yourself!
